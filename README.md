================

For more information and a demo click [here](http://schlegel.github.io/balloon/balloon-synopsis.html)

**RDF data is online - most RDF visualizer are not**

We see the necessity for an easy-to-use RDF visualizer which everybody can embed in a homepage. Therefore we are developing balloon Synopsis. A node-centric RDF viewer & browser in a modern tile design, available as jQuery-plugin.

balloon Synopsis is part of the balloon project (http://schlegel.github.io/balloon). balloon aims at offering public services and tools to take advantage of the semantic web with less effort. 

Our current prototype offers following features:

* HTML/JavaScript RDF Viewer & Browser
* jQuery Plugin
* Automatic information enhancement (intergration of [balloon Fusion](http://schlegel.github.io/balloon/balloon-fusion.html))
* Configurable Templating (aggregate information for human-friendly view e.g. Google Maps instead of long/lat)
* Timeline (track history of the browsing behaviour)
